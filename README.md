# node-wpilib-ws
WebSocket client/server implementations for interfacing with WPILib

## About
This library provides client and server implementations of a WebSocket protocol to allow interaction with robot code running WPILib. This will make use of a currently in-development HALSim extension on the WPILib side that allows an endpoint (such as an application using this library) to interact with user code written with WPILib.
